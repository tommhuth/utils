# Util Javascript wrappers 
 Utility wrappers for local storage, fetch and geo position.
 
 1. `yarn add @huth/utils`
 2. `import { Fetch, LocalStorage, GeoPosition } from "@huth/utils"`

v4 does away with fetch polyfill and drops static class properties ensuring it should work on most modern browser without transpilation.
