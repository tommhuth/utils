# Util Javascript wrappers 
 Utility wrappers for local storage, fetch and geo position.
 
 1. `yarn add @huth/utils`
 2. `import { Fetch, LocalStorage, GeoPosition } from "@huth/utils"`
 

**Todo:** `preset-env` struggles to inject polyfills for NPM packages, bad temporary   solution is to include `core-js` as a dependency here.
